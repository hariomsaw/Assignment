# 2. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple
#    of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a
#    comma-separated sequence on a single line.

# In[28]:


l=[]
for i in range(2000,3201):
    num=i
    if num%7==0 and num%5!=0:
        l.append(i)
print(l)


# 3. Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in
#    the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.

# In[29]:


l=[]
print("Enter the name")
l.append(input())
print("Enter the last name")
l.append(input())
print(*l[::-1],sep=' ')


# 4.  Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
# Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r 3

# In[30]:


r=12
print("volume of a sphere =",((4/3)*(22/7))*r*r*r)


# 5. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and
# generate a list.

# In[31]:


print("Enter th number")
a=input()
b=a.split(',')
b
